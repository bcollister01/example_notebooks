By learning Python, you are not only gaining a valuable tool to help you with your mathematical studies as part of your degree, but also learning the fundamental concepts of programming using a language which is used by innumerable companies, research institutes and ordinary people all over the world.\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main ideas that we want to learn from this tutorial is the idea of a variable. You are familiar with variables in a mathematical sense: we use them in functions. I.E. if we have a function $y=x^2$ we say that $y$ is the dependent *variable* and $x$ the independent *variable*. So the point here is that as the variable $x$ **varies** the variable $y$ also **varies**: This is why they are called variables and not constants. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a variable in programming is slightly different: in fact it is a much broader concept as variables don't just have to be numbers- they can be arrays (vectors or matrices), strings of letters (words) or even logical objects (true or false).\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a variable in Python, we use the '=' sign, i.e to create a variable x which has the value 3, we type\n",

Again, like with variables we have an idea from mathematics of what a function is: For instance a simple one-to-one function of one variable takes one number and maps it to another. e.g. $f(x)=x^3$ maps the number $x$ to it's cube.
