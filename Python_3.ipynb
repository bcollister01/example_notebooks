    "\n",
    "So far we've seen python do some things which we could never have done by hand- constructing large matrices and vectors, plotting thousands of points, etc. already make python a useful tool. However, there's another fundamental aspect of computer programming that we haven't even addressed yet, and it's what makes computer programs useful in most real world operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at vectors, we saw how python can treat a list of numbers all in one go, instead of doing them one at a time. Occasionally however, we come across problems where we need to go step by step. Take the simple example of calculating the terms of the series $T_n=T_{n-1}^2-3$, where $T_0=1$. Clearly $T_1$ depends on $T_0$, $T_2$ depends on $T_1$ and so forth, so we need to calculate the terms in turn, so that we can calculate successive terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple operation we perform in our minds all the time is making either/or decisions. Suppose we have a function  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$f(x)= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    \\frac{x^2-x}{x},& \\text{if } x\\geq 1\\\\\n",
    "    0,              & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "clearly we have to make a decision about which form of the function we use based on the value of x. I.E *\"if x is 1 or bigger do this, otherwise do that\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these examples demonstrate what we think of as logical flow. By default python starts with the first command you execute, and then reads down through your code, executing each statement it reads. When we need to repeatedly do execute some steps, we use a so-called **for** loop, i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "    for <some condition> --> do these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "and if we want to performs something only under certain conditions we use a so-called **if** statement, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if <condition is true> --> do this\n",
    "    otherwise --> do that\n",

Hence in the example above, ````<command 1>, <command 2>```` and ````<commmand 3>```` all get executed repeatedly 'inside' the loop, while ````<normal command>```` just gets executed once at the end, because it is 'outside' the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ````<iterator>```` is the variable which changes each time we loop around. It is common to use ````i```` for this variable, as this is also common in mathematical notation: i.e. $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{10}$. I prefer to use ````ii```` because if your searching through a big piece of code ````i```` will appear in a lot of places- inside other words or variables, whereas ````ii```` will only appear where you've used it as an iterator. All of my examples will use ````ii```` but you can use whatever name you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ````<set_of_values>```` is just that- a set of values. We can use the elements of an array defined using numpy commands like ````linspace````, or ````arange````, or just use simple arrays in square brackets like ````[1,2,3,4]````. \n",
